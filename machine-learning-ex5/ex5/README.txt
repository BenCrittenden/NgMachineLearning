For this exercise you get a short script that calculates the cost function 
and gradient for linear regression in linearRegCostFunction.

You can refer to trainLinearReg for the code to minimize this cost function

polyFeatures adds additional polynomial terms - but this is pretty straight-
forward

validation Curve and learning curving give examples of how you can see if
you're training algorithm is biased or has high variance by checking different
sized training sets and different values of the regularization parameter,
lambda.
