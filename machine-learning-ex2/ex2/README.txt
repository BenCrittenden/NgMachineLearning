Here the useful functions are 

costFunction.m

Also are: (but these are pretty basic)
sigmoid.m
predict.m

Also the plot decision boundary function is pretty clever if I want to draw
boundaries. I think that this is typically done by fabricating two points 
using the formula that you've just found and then just join these two points
with a line.
